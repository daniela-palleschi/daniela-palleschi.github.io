  abstract = {Rating scales and rubrics are commonly used measurement tools in educational contexts. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of controversy surrounding how data derived from these tools can and should be analyzed. One issue that is repeatedly raised is whether these data are ordinal or continuous. A related question is whether parametric data analysis techniques are appropriate and/or acceptable for these rating scale data. Some of this controversy may stem from a misunderstanding of fundamental issues related to these particular tools or a poor use of terminology. This article provides a review of basic issues surrounding measurement of various phenomena relevant to educational settings, as well as previous empirical studies examining the effects of using parametric analysis approaches on rating scale data. Based on previous empirical evidence reviewed in this article, parametric analytical approaches are acceptable provided certain criteria are met. Implications for research and teaching are also briefly discussed. After reading this article, the reader should be able to identify the characteristics of a true Likert scale and explain the situations when parametric analytical techniques are potentially appropriate for rating scale data or when nonparametric techniques are preferred.},

  abstract = {Studies which provide norms of Likert ratings typically report per-item summary statistics. Traditionally, these summary statistics comprise the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the ratings, and the number of observations. Such summary statistics can preserve the rank order of items, but provide distorted estimates of the relative distances between items because of the ordinal nature of Likert ratings. Inter-item relations in such ordinal scales can be more appropriately modelled by cumulative link mixed effects models (CLMMs). In a series of simulations, and with a reanalysis of an existing rating norms dataset, we show that CLMMs can be used to more accurately norm items, and can provide summary statistics analogous to the traditionally reported means and SDs, but which are disentangled from participants’ response biases. CLMMs can be applied to solve important statistical issues that exist for more traditional analyses of rating norms.},

  abstract = {Research in bilingualism often involves quantifying constructs of interest by the use of rating scales: for example, to measure language proficiency, dominance, or sentence acceptability. However, ratings are a type of ordinal data, which violates the assumptions of the statistical methods that are commonly used to analyse them. As a result, the validity of ratings is compromised and the ensuing statistical inferences can be seriously distorted. In this article, we describe the problem in detail and demonstrate its pervasiveness in bilingualism research. We then provide examples of how bilingualism researchers can employ an appropriate solution using Bayesian ordinal models. These models respect the inherent discreteness of ratings, easily accommodate non-normality, and allow modelling unequal psychological distances between response categories. As a result, they can provide more valid, accurate, and informative inferences about graded constructs such as language proficiency.
