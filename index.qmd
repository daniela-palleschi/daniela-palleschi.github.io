:::{#about-heading}


I am currently a scientific support staff member for data science and data management support at the [Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/de/) (ZAS: Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft). I was formerly a scientific staff member (research staff) and statistics consultant at the Institute of German Language and Linguistics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin where I also completed my doctorate under the supervision of Prof. Pia Knoeferle. During my PhD I was a doctoral fellow at the Einstein Center for Neurosciences at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and part of the doctoral program at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain. My research interests include the processing of temporal relations and high-level real-world knowledge, and language processing more broadly.
